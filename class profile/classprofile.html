    <p>
      I'm Grace, and I am a sophomore majoring in Communication Design. I was born in New York but grew up in Shanghai. I'm currently located in NY, and I plan on staying here until I could get my Visa to fly back home. My parents and my brother have been sending me pictures of our Bichon Frise puppy making a mess at home, which I'm glad that I don't have to endure but sad that I'm missing out. 
    </p>
    <p>
      During my free time, I like to do watercolor, exercise, cook, and watch TV shows. During the winter break, I finished watching Bridgerton, Bling Empire, and Emily in Paris. Currently watching the Kdrama "True Beauty".
